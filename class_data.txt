Program is nothing but a set of instructions given to CPU to perform a particular task.
CPU can't understand our language
we can't understand binary language 
So we need a converter to convert our language to binary language
1. compiler 
2. Interpreter 

Languages which uses compiler to convert from high level to low level are called programming languages( Java, C, .net)

Languages which uses interpreter to convert from high level to low level are called Scripting languages ( shell, JS, perl, VB scripting, batch )

1. Name/Identifier should contain only numbers, alphabets and _  
2. It should not start with numbers 
3. It should not contain only numbers 
4. Length of the name can be infinite but it is recommended to use the valid names 
5. Can we use predefined(buitin) names? Yes, but not recommended 
6. we can't use keywords as names ----> Reserved words 

inputs/outputs 
console based 
file based 
web based 
GUI based 
call based 
sms based 
sensor based 

Operators 
Arthimatic operators  ---> +, -, *, /, //, %, ** 
Logical operators -----> and, or, not 
relational(comparative) operators  ----> >, <, ==, >=, <=, != 
Assignment operators -----> =, +=, -=, --> with every arthimatic operator 
bitwise operators ---> |, &, <<, >> 
membership operators  ----> in, not in 
identity operators   ----> is, is not 

All integers(positive or negative) will be converted to True except 0
python is a dynamic typing programming language
